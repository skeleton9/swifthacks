I'm starting this blog to track the learning of Apple's [swift language]
(https://developer.apple.com/swift).

Do not get confused with the http://swift-lang.org, they are different projects.

To develop with swift, you should have XCode 6. Get it from [here]
(http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/download.action?path=/Developer_Tools/xcode_6.1_gm_seed_2_ofnue4/xcode_6.1_gm_seed_2.dmg)
or from the app store on your Mac.

Apple has just released a video for how to build a `swift` app in XCode, check
it out: https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=16
